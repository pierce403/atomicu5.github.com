<p>Welcome to another exciting year of BSides PDX!</p>

<p>test</p>

<p>We’re going out on a limb this year with a new format that will hopefully spice things up and get more people involved and interacting at Bsides PDX 2016. We will try and group together about 3, 20-minute talks into a track, and then get all three speakers together for roundtable-style Q&amp;A.</p>

<p>What does this mean for speakers? If you’re new to speaking, then 20 minutes is WAY more manageable than 50 minutes. If you’ve got a neat topic to present, you don’t have to come up with any filler, and you can get straight to the good stuff.
If you’ve got a 50-minute talk you want to submit, trim off the deep intro from the beginning, and the “why you should be scared” and Q&amp;A from the end, and you should be all set to get your information across in 20 minutes. You’ll have time to answer moderated questions at the end of your track, alongside a couple other speakers. We’re happy to help you trim your content if you need help, and plan to put you in touch with the moderator for your track ahead of time.</p>

<p>The CFP is open NOW!
Round one submissions will be given bonus acceptance points, and must be submitted by Monday August 22nd. We aim to announce Round one submissions by September 5th.
Round two submissions must be submitted by Monday September 19th, to be announced by September 26th.
Again, the conference will be October 14th and 15th.</p>

<p>We hope to have six ‘tracks’ of related talks. Pick the category your talk fits best in - or the topic you feel best equipped to argue at a roundtable about. We will likely adjust the track topics based on the talks submitted.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Security and Usability:
What good is security if noone uses it? Who cares about security as long as users are happy? How do we balance this?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reality of attribution and privacy
How will attribution fix the internet? Why do you think your privacy is more important than that?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hardware is the New Software
How will implementing your widget in hardware fix security once and for all? How will it make hacking that much easier?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Software is the New Hardware
How will virtualizing your hardware finally fix security? How will this guarantee job security for Infosec?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wireless is the New Wired
Information wants to be free of wires, the FCC will protect my data, right?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prevention vs. Detection
If only we could stop attacks in the first place, we’d win. If only we could detect attacks we wouldn’t have to prevent them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s Always CLOUDy in Portland
Tell us how your cloud solution will make the world secure. Tell us how their cloud solution will get everyone hacked.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I Hacked This!
Tell us about your project where you broke, fixed, made, or re-made something, even if it doesn’t have security implications. Hopefully this will be a showcase of cool projects around Portland.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>TBD/Other/Undefined
You tell us!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In addition to submitting talks, please consider teaching a workshop. We’re thinking 90 to 120 minute time slots. Teach people how to find bugs in websites, break wireless networks, poke into hardware, or even show people how they can properly protect their privacy. If you know how to do it, and you think it will take a few hours to explain it, there’s likely a room full of students that will be eager to lean.</p>

<p>Do you want to run a contest? We’ve had some fun ones in the past, so if you have an idea for a fun challenge to do during the conference, we’d love to hear it! Fill out the details below.</p>
